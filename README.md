# daBML Framework â€“ Pre-publication Materials

This repository supports the validation and dissemination of the **daBML framework**, developed and tested as part of the MSc thesis *"Validating a Framework for Generative AI Adoption in Software Startups"* by Gijs Oliemans (University of Amsterdam, 2025). The framework builds on and extends the **Build-Measure-Learn** cycle with upstream phases for more strategic and risk-aware Generative AI adoption in resource-constrained environments like startups.

The repository contains:

- ðŸ“„ **Whitepaper** (pre-publication version): Detailed conceptual explanation of the daBML framework, to be published in the *Advances in Software Startups: Engineering, Business and Beyond* volume.
- ðŸ§© **daBML Worksheet**: A practical worksheet designed to guide startup teams through structured AI adoption discussions using daBML.
- ðŸ’¼ **Use Cases**: A collection of curated startup scenarios and GenAI applications used during the validation workshop.

## ðŸ“š What is daBML?

**daBML** stands for:

- **Define** â€“ Clarify innovation goals, scoping, and KPIs.
- **Analyse** â€“ Assess technical, ethical, and feasibility constraints.
- **Build** â€“ Develop a minimal viable implementation.
- **Measure** â€“ Evaluate performance using both quantitative and qualitative insights.
- **Learn** â€“ Reflect on outcomes and iterate.

This extended loop is especially tailored to early-stage or fast-moving startup teams needing lightweight but strategically grounded adoption guidance for Generative AI.

## ðŸ§ª About the Workshop

As part of the thesis validation process, the daBML framework was tested in a structured workshop with startup founders, product leads, and researchers. Participants applied daBML to practical GenAI adoption cases, evaluated its relevance, practicality, and actionability, and contributed critical feedback for its refinement.
